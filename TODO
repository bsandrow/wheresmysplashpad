- Some parks don't have good coordinates. E.g. Toronto Island park has it's
  address at the Ferry departure point along Queen's Quay rather than
  coordinates actually *on* Toronto Island.
- Getting good coordinates for where the splash pads actually are. Possibly by
  finding the splash pads and geocoding them ourselves, using our phone's GPS?
- Better info window information.
- Updating this from being a static page, to allowing user input on whether or
  not the splash pads are open / functioning.
- Add the information about the dates that the splash pads are open this summer
  somewhere.
- Link to the Toronto.ca splash pads site somewhere
